Accountant
=====

> Accountant is a Laravel application with a simple goal; keep track of your running budget / expense / income tallies.

### Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/boboman13/accountant && cd accountant
$ php artisan serve
```

This will serve the application via the built-in PHP server. It is sometimes recommended to use Nginx to serve Laravel, or it may be wanted depending on your installation; [view this link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-laravel-with-nginx-on-an-ubuntu-12-04-lts-vps) for a tutorial.
